# PRODIGY_ML_03

This repository contains my submission for the **Prodigy ML Internship Program - Task 03**.

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to apply fundamental machine learning techniques to a dataset using Python and popular libraries. It includes steps like:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and testing
- Evaluation metrics

## 📁 Files in This Repo

- `PRODIGY_ML_03.ipynb`: The main Colab notebook with code and output
- `README.md`: This file – gives an overview of the project
- `requirementss.txt` : Python dependencies 
## 🧪 How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run each cell step-by-step.
3. Install any required packages using:
   ```python
   !pip install -r requirements.txt
